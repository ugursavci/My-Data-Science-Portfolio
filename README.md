# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.


## Project 1: [Customer Churn Analysis](https://github.com/ugursavci/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Customer_Churn_Analysis)

- Predicted Customer Churn for Telecom company
- Deployed machine learning model using Flask,Docker and AWS 
- Application link : http://ec2-54-86-44-145.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5000/

## Project 2: [Flight Fare Price Prediction](https://github.com/ugursavci/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Flight%20Price) : 
 
- Predicted Flight ticket price using regression model.

## Project 3: [Absenteeism Project](https://github.com/ugursavci/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Absenteeism_Project) : 

- In this project, We will address absenteeism problem in a company and predict our absenteeism level which are seperated moderately and extremely absent .

## Project 4:[Mall Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/ugursavci/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Mall_Customer_Segmentation):

- We already know how important marketing is. In this Project, KMeans algorithm has been used for customer segmentation and clustering problem.
- So that We are able to know our customers shopping behaviour more accurately.

## Project 5: [Human Resources](https://github.com/ugursavci/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Human_Resources)

- Built  a classification model that helps us to learn  which employees are more likely to quit their job!

## Project 6: [Breast Cancer Project](https://github.com/ugursavci/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Breast_Cancer_Project-main):

- In this project,We will predict the stage of breast Cancer M (Malignant) and B (Bengin)
