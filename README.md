# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.


## Project 1: [Flight Fare Price Prediction](https://github.com/ugursavci/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Flight%20Price) : 
 
- Predicted Flight ticket price using regression model.

## Project 2: [Absenteeism Project](https://github.com/ugursavci/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Absenteeism_Project) : 

- In this project, We will address absenteeism problem in a company and predict our absenteeism level which are seperated moderately and extremely absent .

## Project 3:[Mall Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/ugursavci/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Mall_Customer_Segmentation):

- We already know how important marketing is. In this Project, KMeans algorithm has been used for customer segmentation and clustering problem.

- In this project,We will predict the stage of breast Cancer M (Malignant) and B (Bengin)
- 
## Project 6: [Amazon Alexa Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/ugursavci/My-Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Public_Relationns/Alexa_Review_Classification.ipynb):

- Built machine learning algorithm to classify feedback from alexa customer reviews.Throughout this project ; Exploratory Data Analysis,Cleaned up and vectorized text.
- Used Naive Bayes Algorithm and Logistic Regression to classify feedback.
