## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The libraries required for the successful execution of this code are mentioned in requirements.txt. In order to install all the libraries:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using the various Recommendation Systems' Algorithms in order to recommend articles in the IBM Watson Studio Platform. The main notebook is divided into four parts:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Rank Based Recommendations
3. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
4. Matrix Factorization


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are two main files in this project `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb` which contains all the code for the Recommendation Systems. And `project_tests.py` which contain the tests to ensure that the algorithms are implemented correctly

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
